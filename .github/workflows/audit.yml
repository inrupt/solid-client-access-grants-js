      # dependency when running an audit.
      # If this task fails, first attempt to run `npm audit fix` or upgrade the
      # relevant dependency; when that does not work, you can add the transitive
      # dependency to the `resolutions` field in package.json according to the
      # instructions in `npm-force-resolutions`'s README.
