# End-to-end tests for template-ts in Node

## Running the tests

To run the tests locally:

1. At the root, run `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.test.local`.
3. Run `npx @inrupt/generate-oidc-token` to obtain the credentials of the Pod
   you want the test to run against, and add them to `.env.test.local`.
4. You can now run `npm run e2e-test-node` from the root.

## Running these End-to-End-specific tests from an IDE

To run these tests from your IDE, you may need to setup your test configuration
to pick up the End-2-End-specific Jest configuration file from the root folder
of this mono-repo.

For example, in IntelliJ you may need to add `--config=jest.e2e.config.js` to
the Jest options of the 'Run/Debug Configurations' modal dialog box.
