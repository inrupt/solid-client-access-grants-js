/**
 * Given a SolidDataset, store it in a Solid Pod in a new Resource inside a Container.
 *
 * The Container at the given URL should already exist; if it does not, you can initialise it first
 * using [[createContainerAt]], or directly save the SolidDataset at the desired location using
 * [[saveSolidDatasetAt]].
 *
 * This function is primarily useful if the current user does not have access to change existing files in
 * a Container, but is allowed to add new files; in other words, they have Append, but not Write
 * access to a Container. This is useful in situations where someone wants to allow others to,
 * for example, send notifications to their Pod, but not to view or delete existing notifications.
 * You can pass a suggestion for the new Resource's name, but the server may decide to give it
 * another name — for example, if a Resource with that name already exists inside the given
 * Container.
 * If the user does have access to write directly to a given location, [[saveSolidDatasetAt]]
 * will do the job just fine, and does not require the parent Container to exist in advance.
 *
 * @see [@inrupt/solid-client's
 * saveSolidDatasetInContainer](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/api/javascript/solid-client/modules/resource_solidDataset.html#savesoliddatasetincontainer)
 *
 *
 * @param containerUrl URL of the Container in which to create a new Resource.
 * @param solidDataset The [[SolidDataset]] to save to a new Resource in the given Container.
 * @param options Optional parameter `options.fetch`: An alternative `fetch` function to make the HTTP request, compatible with the browser-native [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#parameters).
 * @returns A Promise resolving to a [[SolidDataset]] containing the saved data. The Promise rejects if the save failed.
