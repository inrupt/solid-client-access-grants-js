/**
 * Create an empty Container inside the Container at the given URL.
 *
 * Throws an error if creating the Container failed, e.g. because the current user does not have
 * permissions to. In particular, the Access Grant being used should at least append access to the target Container.
 *
 * The Container in which to create the new Container should itself already exist.
 *
 * This function is primarily useful if the current user does not have access to change existing files in
 * a Container, but is allowed to add new files; in other words, they have Append, but not Write
 * access to a Container. This is useful in situations where someone wants to allow others to,
 * for example, send notifications to their Pod, but not to view or delete existing notifications.
 * You can pass a suggestion for the new Resource's name, but the server may decide to give it
 * another name â€” for example, if a Resource with that name already exists inside the given
 * Container.
 * If the user does have access to write directly to a given location, createContainerAt
 * will do the job just fine, and does not require the parent Container to exist in advance.
 *
 * @param containerUrl URL of the Container in which the empty Container is to
 * be created.
 * @param accessGrant The Access Grant that would allow the Agent/Application to
 * perform this operation.
 * @param options Optional parameter:
 * - `options.fetch`: An alternative `fetch` function to make the HTTP request,
 *   compatible with the browser-native [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#parameters).
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a SolidDataset with ResourceInfo if
 * successful, and that rejects otherwise.
 * @since 2.1.0
